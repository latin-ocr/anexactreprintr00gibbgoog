Erasmus, after having been placed in the second class
in the Tridentine catalogue, is not treated with much
lenity by the Theologians 01 Louvain, in the Belgio
index. The expurgatione prescribed occupy from page
225, to 287, in the small reprint 01 J unius ς but in his
case, as well as in that 01 others, the succeeding
densors, instead 01 improving iu liteness, proficiunt

quisite, in 53 closely printed 'folio pages ; and his direc-
tions are followed by Sotomaior‚ Modra’d, MDCXL,
and Vidal Mario, MDcchr. It deserves to bc
noted, thet in these last three Indexes, Erasmusq is

ru

lc magnas firisse fertur. This corruption may be seen in the editions
01 Antwerp, Motxlx, Rothom, Mnch, Paris, M'Dcxxrv, and
MDCLXXVll.; but it does not appear in the impression, Salmant,
1⁵49, nor in two copies which are in my possession, Salmone, 1551,
p. 569, aud 111311, 111101.,1. 116. At the end 01 the latter volume are
the newly discovered Canens 01 the first Nicone Council, which
Nicolinus had given in his (1011011. Vener. MDLXXXV. Conceruing
these Sutcliffe writes thus: “And now of late 'one Alphonsus 01
fisa, a lebusite, hath set out 86 Canens 01 that Councell, translated,
aa he saith, 001 of Arabiates. He might haue done well to h'ave said,
translated out 01 the language of China3 fortheri rather would
diuers haue beleeued 111010, then gone 10 Chlna, 10 search or
examine tile truth oi Alphonsus his report’' (Of diuers salsittes,
p. 166. challenge, Loud. 1602.)
0 My copy has the autograph, Antonio Alacres de la Puente,
(Secretary 01 the King and Councih) on the verso 01 the title-page.

Possevine (Bibl. Sel, p. 91.) quotes the sayiag: Erasmus innuit,
Lutherus irruit: Erasmus dubitet, Lutli'arus assereret: Erasmus
parit oua, Lutherus excludit pullos. Vide lad. Brasichell., p. ³14,
F. Nausea, in his Mauortia upon Erasmus's death, speaks 01 the
Pape, ‘¹ qui sua dudum sacrosancta authoritate doctrinam Erasmi
modis omnibus adprobauit.” (Goion. MDXXXVI.) Nausea was the
author 01 ε’ tract, in which there is much Christian feeling shown :
