MDCCXIV. Toplady says ‘rather conternptuously : ‘⁶ Some 01101-
lent things are, indeed, interspersed in their ivritings; hut the goldert
grains are almost lost emidst an infinity 01 rubbisli.” (Meditatr'ons,
p. 1⁸25. Dub. 1831.) l amsorry 10111111 that 111. M‘Ghee imagines,
thot references to Councils, and Fathers, only give riae to “ahsurd
and hopeless 'questions;’' and that “in the use of these weapons,
with which alone their Churclr can be defended, several of the Roman
Catholie Priests, men 01 learning, and genius, and ability, are per-
fectly competent 10 meet any 01 the most able opponente, who could
be arrayedin discussion against them.” ( Troili 01111 Error currarent
11179. Duh. 1330. Vide Addrees 10 a. 0., pp. xxix-xxx.) Mr.
Finch declaresit 10 be his purpose, “to sink 1110 fathers ;'' ,whose
worlrs “present us with a chaotic confusion, which rendere all the
efforts of the controversialist, uho is so ignorant or so papistical as
to appeal to them in support of his doctrines, perfectly nugatory.”
(Sketclr os tlte Romish controversy, Preface, pp. iv-v. Lond. 1331.)
Mr. Maurice, with a first-rate neoterio spirit, considers the Fathers
as “little deserving our notice on points of doctrine,'’ and thinks
that “they may be made to say any thing we please.” (Tire
Poperp osOasord ! p. 62. Lond. 1331.) These are the prerailing
notione 01 modern times; and it ought 1101 10 1000111111οη1 mem
to us, 10 know, that Socinians make use of similar language.
Smalcius says: Totius mundi (prater Apostolos) authoritas 111
religione hulla est. (Resut. 2. lib. Smiglec'ii, de error. 1100. Arion.
Vide Barlow's Directions, p. 21.) 11 11 easy to understand why
Gibbon constantly sneers at the early Christian writers3 and also
what reason the author of the Second Traoeir osan frisii ow
11011011 had, 101 expressing himself, “ with little respect for 111011113-
ment, add knowledge 01 those pretended 1101110100 of tradition, the
Fathers.'' (Vol. 1. p. 1⁵2. Dnh. 1833.) ’1110 best antidote against
such opinions, as far as they relate 10 Popery, may be found ln 1110
challenge 01 the illusfflous sewen* who selecta twenty-seven dia·
puted points, and declares,v that “ if any man aliue were able to
