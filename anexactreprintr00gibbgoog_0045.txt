b Francis Moncaeius published at Atrebatium, in the year loco, a
book eutitled, Aaron purgatur and prefixed to it a dedication to
Pope Paul V., as he tells him, with the grestem propriety, because
the Chios Pontid' murt necessarily belnterested about his predecessor.
The volume appeared with the approbation ol Joan. Buchoerus,
Paris. Theoi& Canon. Toruac„ and of Paul Bovdot, Acad. Paris.
Theol.; librorum Censor, &c r but three years asterwards, the Popc,
whose favour was souglrt l'or by this deleuce ol his cause, had the
bookprohtbirsm· aud this sentence was renewed by Alexander
v11., in whose ludex it is the lirst condemned. The author, know·
ing very well, that the Christian Church is in many respectsaconti·
·uuatiou of the Jewish; but at the same time connecting without rea-
·sou the office of Aaron with that os the Pope‚ endeavours most iuge·
uiously in this work to lree the former from idolatry‚ in order to
prevent Protestanta from making any use oi the comparison. lt is
probable’s that Moncoeius would have been treated better, but that a
'more simple mode oi getting rid of the difficulty had beeu a few
years before discovered by Gratum, who, ln the Colloquy atllatisbou,t
answered Heilbrunner thus: Aaron nou luit superior Moyse, quia
Moyses habuit ante Aaronem sacerdotium, ideo respectu summi aa·
cerdatij‚ nihil luit peccatum simpliciter, quia Moyses nou peccauit.
