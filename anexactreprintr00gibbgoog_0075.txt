Our early Divines were not afraid tolet their contro-
yersies be deeided by the voice 01 tlre primitive Church,
5 001 did they think 11 0 disperagement to 1110 Scriptures,

toappeal 1011111000 testimony, for historioal proof 01
= the novelty of Popery. Their learning enabled them to
say to their fellow Protestants, as 101101ς did 101110
hearers: “ keepe your hold, the Doetours and old
Catholike Fathers‚ in the points that I haue spoken 01,
are yours‚ ye shall see the siege raised, ye shall see your
aduersaries discomfeited, and put to ssight;'’ and none
hut they, whom Dr. James callst “faint Sonldiers 01
001 side,’' have ever denied his 0110011100, that 111010-
quisite 101 us to 11001001 opponente with “the lorcible¹
veapon 01 Antiquity‚ and drive them 001 01 the strong
Fort of Fathers, and ancient Writers, which they have
00 long time, by violence andinjury, held 11001 00.”“
11110100 says :v Petrum dicta & documenta eum vene·

omnia testimonia absolute despici. “The saith which
they prolessed and derived from scripture, we profess
also; and in the same faith‚ 1110 hope 10110 saved 0000
0011100. But for the new Doctors3 we understand them
001, we know thern not: Our saith is the same from the
beginning, and cannot become rrew.’'w N onobstant ces
